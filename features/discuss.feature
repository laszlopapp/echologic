# Open Questions:

# * should we always display in which other languages the statement might also exist, or always trust that the order of languages the user speaks is right"?
# ** Do we have an order of languages anyway? If the user can only use checkboxes for selecting languages she speaks, it's impossible to figure out more order than local language, other languages.
# In this case we should really display the user in what languages (he speaks) the statement has translations

# * what should i actually see when i navigate directly to a proposal without a translation into any language i speak (for example through an direct link?)
