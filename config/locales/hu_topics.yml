          All PEP-NET members are invited to join this discussion on the future of PEP-NET.
        description: |-
          <p>
          In May 2010, a Temporary Steering Committee was formed after the general meeting of PEP‐NET held in Krems,
          Austria. The aim of this committee was to <strong>prepare a vision statement and agenda for the
          new entity</strong> that many partners would appreciate to be born after the end of the EU funding for
          the project – approximately by the end of this year.
          In order to collect meaningful and useful information from the current members on the future of
          PEP‐NET, the results of the steering committee's work were taken over to echo to be further
          deliberated.
          The results of this online-deliberation will serve as a starting point for the PEP-NET conference on
          the 23th of September in Hamburg.
          </p><p>
          The deliberative process is divided into two stages:
            <ol>
              <li>
                An initial <strong>brainstorming stage</strong> (taking place from July 19. to Aug. 15) to
                collect problems, opinions and make the support for different positions visible.
              </li>
              <li>
                A <strong>drafting stage</strong> (starting on Aug. 16 and lasting until Sept. 19) to aggregate brainstorming
                results into jointly elaborated proposals.

        teaser: |
          The ECI Advisory Board creates recommendations on how to make the European Citizens´ Initiative an
          effective instrument for a more participative Europe.
        description: |-
          <p>
          The ECI Advisory Board is a non official forum. Together with Matthias Groote and Gerald Haefner,
          it was founded by a <strong>core of experts</strong> from a range of member states
          with backing from a growing number of MEPs.
          </p><p>
          Its overall goal is to <strong>bail out ECIs potential</strong> to become a means of discursive
          appropriation of Europe by its citizens, making them co-authors of the European endeavor and thus to
          reestablish citizens´ faith in European democracy. The board will <strong>elaborate recommendations</strong>
          on the different aspects concerning ECIs effective implementation. This includes the development of concepts
          for a consistent combination of <strong>offline and online methods for deliberation and proactive agenda
          setting</strong>. The recommendations elaborated by the board will be presented to the
          European Parliament, the responsible committees and the European Commission.
          </p><p>
            The deliberative process is divided into two stages:
            <ol>
              <li>
                An initial <strong>brainstorming stage</strong> (taking place from Aug. 6 to Aug. 18) to collect
                problems, opinions and make the support for different positions visible.
              </li>
              <li>
                A <strong>drafting stage</strong> (starting on Aug. 18 and lasting until Sept. 6) to aggregate
                brainstorming results into jointly elaborated proposals.
