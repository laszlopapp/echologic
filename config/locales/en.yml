        vision: |
         <p>
         In the long term, the My echo area will be your <strong>personal information hub</strong> inside of echo. E.g. it will provide
         you with the most <strong>important news</strong> and call your attention to the most <strong>recent discussions and actions</strong> according
         to your preferences.

        text: |
          <p>Defining a *tag (starting with ONE *) will make this discussion semi-closed. Users must define the same
          *tag as a decision making tag in their profile to be able to participate in the discussion, however it
          will remain visible and transparent to the outside world.</p>
          <p>Defining a **tag (with TWO **) will make this discussion fully closed. It will only be visible for users
          having the same **tag as a decision making tag in their profile.</p>
          <p>Please note, that this is just a temporary solution to facilitate closed discussions in echo. The real
          solution with contact lists, invitations and fine-graded access right management will be coming later.</p>
